tape.tv has been around since 2008 and has been dedicated to bringing you quality music videos ever since. If you are a long time music video fan using tape.tv you will have noticed that there have been a lot of changes to the platform in the last few years. This has been the result of great effort in all departments, resulting in a shift of strategy, design and technology. Old tape.tv was built on a stack which, at the time, was an impressive integration of technologies including Java, Flash, PHP and MySQL to name a few.

In late 2013, along with many other strategic decisions, it was decided that tape.tv needed to move to a technology stack that would allow us to become much more agile in the way that we conceived, built, tested and deployed new features. In order to do this, we committed to rebuilding and switching out every part of tape.tv using a service oriented architecture. This allowed us to take a piecemeal approach to tearing down a fairly massive system and completely rebuilding it from the ground up.

Ruby and Ruby on Rails was chosen as the strongest candidate to rebuild most of the systems that drive the delivery of video content to you the customer, but also most of the company systems that crank away in the background, such as heavy duty video transcoding, ingestion of content from many record labels, automated reporting to those labels and the collection of metrics to help us figure out if what we are doing is right.

Add to this the obvious need to build high quality mobile applications using iOS and Android, like tape express and our Android and Apple TV apps, it was clear that we had to support our mobile engineers with fast dedicated APIs which could change and adapt quickly without losing quality or agility.

With this little history lesson now done, welcome to the tape.tv tech blog! Here, we will let you know what we're doing and how we're doing it. We hope to share and give back to the tech community a fraction of what we have gained by being a part of it. Thanks for reading, please do subscribe and we'll be back to you soon with interesting articles about our adventures in music and tech.
