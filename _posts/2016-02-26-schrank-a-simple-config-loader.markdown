Whenever we set up a new Ruby application, we face the problem of how
to store access credentials and other settings in a way that:

1. Keeps secrets out of version control;
1. Can be changed per application environment;
1. Is not a huge pain in development.

Our solution to that problem is [Schrank][schrank].

It's a tiny gem that loads configuration from a YAML file. You can
provide a hash of defaults in case the file doesn't exist and, in development
only, the defaults are merged with the YAML.

The latter sounds strange at first, we know. But we like it this way because *there
are two types of configuration â€“ things you are happy to have in version
control and things you aren't*.

In production and staging, our config is managed via Chef. We have a data bag
per environment which we don't want to merge with the defaults. In
development, we have our config split in two.

Values that are safe to put into version control, such as tokens
shared by the whole team, are written in as defaults. Other values,
such as personal AWS credentials, are read from the development YAML file.

Here's what our usage tends to look like:

{% highlight ruby %}
$config = Schrank.load(Rails.root.join("config/#{Rails.env}.yml")) do
  {
    foo: 'bar',
    baz: 420
  }
end
{% endhighlight %}

If you have the same problem and you want a really minimal solution,
we encourage you to check out [Schrank][schrank] and let us know what you
think!
